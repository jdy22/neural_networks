part1_nn_lib.py contains a mini neural network library. Run part1_nn_lib.py will fit an example neural network model on iris dataset based on the mini library.

part2_house_value_regression.py fits a tuned neural network model on the given dataset. 80% of the given dataset is used to train and tune the model and the rest of 20% is used to test the model performance.
