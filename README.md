part1_nn_lib.py contains a mini neural network library. Running part1_nn_lib.py will fit an example neural network model on the iris dataset using the mini library. This is done by shuffling the iris dataset, then splitting it into 80% training data and 20% test data. The neural network is trained on the training data using the mini library, then evaluated using the test data. The cross entropy loss on the training and test datasets are reported, along with the prediction accuracy on the test set. To modify model parameters, change "neurons" and "activations" in the function example_main(), and to modify training parameters, change these for the "trainer" in example_main().

part2_house_value_regression.py fits a tuned neural network model on the given "housing.csv" dataset using the PyTorch library. 80% of the given dataset is used to train and tune the model and the remaining 20% is used to test the model performance. Running part2_house_value_regression.py will train a regressor using the best hyperparameters found during our hyperparameter search. The regressor is then evaluated and it's score on the test set is reported. To modify model parameters, change these for the "regressor" in the function example_main().
